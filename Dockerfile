# Run Chrome Headless in a container
#
# What was once a container using the experimental build of headless_shell from
# tip, this container now runs and exposes stable Chrome headless via
# google-chome --headless.
#
# What's New
#
# 1. Pulls from Chrome Stable
# 2. You can now use the ever-awesome Jessie Frazelle seccomp profile for Chrome.
#     wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles/master/etc/docker/seccomp/chrome.json -O ~/chrome.json
#
#
# To run (without seccomp):
# docker run -d -p 9222:9222 --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN justinribeiro/chrome-headless
#
# To run a better way (with seccomp):
# docker run -d -p 9222:9222 --security-opt seccomp=$HOME/chrome.json justinribeiro/chrome-headless
#
# Basic use: open Chrome, navigate to http://localhost:9222/
#

# Base docker image
